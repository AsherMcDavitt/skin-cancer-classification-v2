# skin-cancer-classification-v2
## A machine learning model designed to classify benign or malignant skin cancer.

Description:
I created a machine learning model to help classify skin lesions as benign or malignant, aiming to support early detection of skin cancer. The model achieved over 85% validation accuracy by using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as the foundation and a custom classification head.

Built with Python, TensorFlow, and NumPy, I applied techniques like data normalization and augmentation (rotation, zoom, and flipping) to make the model more robust and adaptable.

To optimize training, I used tools like early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and prediction logging.

This project demonstrates how AI can play a valuable role in healthcare by providing dermatologists and healthcare professionals with a reliable, scalable tool to complement their expertise in diagnosing skin cancer.


How to run:
The Python file is the code for creating the model and saving it as an h5 model file. At the end of running the program, a graph will show the accuracy and loss over the epochs of the model.

NOTE: this project may see improvements/developments in the future.
